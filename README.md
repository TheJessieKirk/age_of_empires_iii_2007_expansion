### 1.2 Single Player Campaign

#### _Blood, Ice and Steal_ Act 1

    * Morgan Black says "good work" when all treasures have been gathered.
    * There are Ottoman dingies on the shore, as these were established in _The Falcon Lands on Malta_.

* In _Answers_, the hoop throwers have been replaced with crossbowmen _(I didn't want them to just disapear at the start of Into the Caves, nor did I want to make the secondary objective of building hoop throwers too easy __-Jess__)_.

* In _Into the Caves_:
    *  You now start with 3 additional crossbowmen and 3 additional spearmen, as they are established in _Answers_.
    *  The secondary objective "find a shipwreck and gather any supplies near it" is now fixed so you can complete it, and Morgan Black says "good work" when you do.

* In _Lizzie the Pirate_, all Maltese caravels are now galleys.

* In _PIRATES!_:
    * The caravel that gets blown up at the start, and any caravels that are sent from Malta, are now galleys.
    * You now start with two additional highlanders, as they are established in _Lizze the Pirate_.

* In _The New World_, the caravel is now a galley.

* In _The Ottoman Fort_:
    * The unresearchable Champion Kalinago, Champion Maya and Champion Mēxihcah technologies no longer appear. 
    * You now start with 2 additional hoop throwers and 2 highlanders, as they are established in _The New World_.
    * You start with 2 pikemen instead of 3, to offset the advantage of having additional troop types somewhat.
    * Starting units now move a very short distance from the shore to prevent overcrowding. 

* In _Secrets of the New World_:
    * The caravel is now a galley.
    * The unresearchable Champion Mēxihcah technology no longer appears.
    * You can now build walls.

* In _A Pirate's Help_:
    * The Spanish church is now converted to your control when you defeat the first Kalinago raid.
    * You can now build a church, outposts and walls.
    * You now can't research the Mercantalism technology (which was not required before as you didn't have a church).
    * The trade route is already set to Level 1 (stagecoach), as Cuba is an established colony.

* In _The Floria Coast_, the unresearchable Champion Tawantinsuyu technology no longer appears.

* In _The Fountain of Youth?_, you can now build outposts and walls.

#### _Blood, Ice and Steal_ Act 2

* In _Strange Alliances_, John Black's sexist remark to Stuart Black has been changed to "Stuart, protect the wounded."

* In _The Rescue_:
    * You can now research Champion Haudenosaunee.
    * Added a small, revealed path to show where John Black's party marched onto the map from, rather than just appearing out of nowhere.

    * Replaced outpost with a watch tower (actually a fort tower) to stop the player sending shipments to it.
    * Replaced the default grass texture that was underneath the British mills with a New England one.
    * Removed British surgeons and priests because they just stood there and did nothing.

### 1.3 Random Names

* The Circle of Ossus now have more random names for their caravels and galleons. These names have been taken from [The Medieval Beastiary](<https://www.bestiary.ca/index.html>) and _The Key of Solomon_, and every single name from these sources were used.  _(For a secret-order-of-European-scientists/exorcist feel. _White Jaguar_ and _White Turtle_ are the only names that were not in a medieval beastiary, and _White Merle_ has been used instead of _White Blackbird_ due to "blackbird" already having a colour in it  __-Jess__)_
