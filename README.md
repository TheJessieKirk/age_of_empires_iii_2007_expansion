## 1 Changes

### 1.1 Single Player Campaign

* In _Blood, Ice and Steal Act 1: Breakout_, Alain Magnan's "knights" are now guard lancers instead of imperial hussars. _(I felt this a better reflection of the "knights" Morgan Black refers to, as well as the "heavy cavalry" Alain Magnan refers to __-Jess__)_

* The Knights of St. John now uses a more historically-accurate _Sovereign Military Order of Malta Flag of the Order's Works_; a white Maltese cross defacing a red field. Based on [_"Bandiera del Sovrano Militare Ordine di Malta.svg"_](<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bandiera_del_Sovrano_Militare_Ordine_di_Malta.svg>). Public domain.

* Alain Magnan now has retextured caparison and jupon to match the new flag design detailed above. 

* _St. Elmo_ (Morgan's flagship) now has retextured sails to match the new flag design detailed above.
