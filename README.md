## 1 Changes

### 1.1 Single Player Campaign

#### _Blood, Ice and Steal_ Act 1
* The Knights of St. John now use a more historically-accurate _Sovereign Military Order of Malta Flag of the Order's Works_; a white Maltese cross defacing a red field. Based on "[_Bandiera del Sovrano Militare Ordine di Malta.svg_](<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bandiera_del_Sovrano_Militare_Ordine_di_Malta.svg>)". Public domain.

* Alain Magnan now has a retextured caparison and jupon to match the new flag design detailed above. 

* _St. Elmo_ (Morgan's flagship) now has retextured sails to match the new flag design detailed above.

* The Knights of St. John now have galleys instead of caravels, as this is more historically accurate.

* In _Breakout_, Alain Magnan's "knights" are now guard lancers instead of imperial hussars. _(I felt this a better reflection of the "knights" Morgan Black refers to, as well as the "heavy cavalry" Alain Magnan refers to __-Jess__)_

* In _Into the Caves_, the secondary objective "find a shipwreck and gather any supplies near it" nis now fixed so you can complete it.

* In _PIRATES!_, the caravel that gets blown up at the start, and any caravels that would be sent from Malta, are now galleys to reflect changes above.
