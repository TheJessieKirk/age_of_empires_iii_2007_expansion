* In _Into the Caves_:
    *  You now start with 3 additional crossbowmen and 3 additional spearmen, as they are established in _Answers_.
    *  The secondary objective "find a shipwreck and gather any supplies near it" is now fixed so you can complete it, and Morgan Black says "good work" when you do.

    * Replaced highlanders with jaegers, as they are established in _The Next Day_.
    * Removed docks.

### 1.3 Random Names

#### The Circle of Ossus
* The Circle of Ossus now have more random names for their caravels, galleons, frigates and monitors. These names have been taken from [The Medieval Beastiary](<https://www.bestiary.ca/index.html>), [The Key of Solomon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_of_Solomon>) and the [Labours of Hercules](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules>). Every single name from these sources was used.  _(For a secret-order-of-European-scientists/exorcist feel. _White Jaguar_ and _White Turtle_ are the only names that were not in a medieval beastiary, and _White Merle_ has been used instead of _White Blackbird_ due to "blackbird" already having a colour in it  __-Jess__)_
